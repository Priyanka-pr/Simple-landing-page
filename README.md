# Simple-landing-page
 This is a landing  page that have simple codes, comments and spacing to make everything readable.
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used in front-end. This is a static and responsive Landing Page.
	The reason I put the JavaScript at the end, was just in case it took time to load all the html and css would have loaded and the visitor would have something to see.
